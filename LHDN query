Dear Sir / Madam,

Good day.

I am writing to seek your official clarification regarding my Malaysian tax residency position for the years 2025 and 2026, under Section 7 of the Income Tax Act 1967 and Public Ruling No. 6/2011 (Residence Status of Individuals).



Below is my actual scenario:

First entry into Malaysia: 03 August 2025.

I will remain in Malaysia mainly for work(Employement Pass) until the end of 2025.

I will not reach 182 days in 2025, but I plan to be physically present in Malaysia on both 31 December 2025 and 01 January 2026 to link the two years.

In 2026, I will ensure that I stay in Malaysia for 182 days or more so that year will definitely qualify as a resident year.



During 2025, I will have two short absences from Malaysia, as follows:

Absence 1: 12 days (social visit abroad – personal reason)

Absence 2: 11 days (personal health problems and must needed hospital appointments)

Total Absence: 23 days



I will be physically in Malaysia immediately before and after each absence.

Thus, the total absence from Malaysia in 2025 will be 23 days in total (12 + 11).


My questions for official confirmation:

1. As per Section 7(1)(b) and the temporary-absence provisions, can these two absences (12 days + 11 days) still be treated as temporary absences forming part of my continuous presence, given that one is a social visit (≤ 14 days) and the other is for health reason(self)?

2. Will this affect my eligibility to link the year 2025 to 2026 for tax-residency purposes under the “linking rule”?

3. What supporting documents should I keep or submit (e.g., medical proof, passport stamps) to substantiate this position during filing or any future verification?

4. In my case, Can I claim back my excess tax for 2025 and 2026 after becoming a resident in 2026 ? 

5. Can I take one more 10 days of break from Malaysia, to follow up my health checkups in either March/April 2026 ?


I sincerely appreciate your time and guidance on this matter.

A written clarification from your office will help me ensure my tax filings and records are fully compliant with LHDN requirements.



Thank you very much.



Warm regards,

Pradeep Kandasamy.
