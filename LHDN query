Dear Sir / Madam,



Good day.

I am writing to seek your official clarification regarding my Malaysian tax residency position for the years 2025 and 2026, under Section 7 of the Income Tax Act 1967 and Public Ruling No. 6/2011 (Residence Status of Individuals).



Below is my actual scenario:

First entry into Malaysia: 03 August 2025.

I will remain in Malaysia mainly for work and personal purposes until the end of 2025.

I will not reach 182 days in 2025, but I plan to be physically present in Malaysia on both 31 December 2025 and 01 January 2026 to link the two years.

In 2026, I will ensure that I stay in Malaysia for 182 days or more so that year will definitely qualify as a resident year.



During 2025, I will have two short absences from Malaysia, as follows:

Absence 1: 10 days (social visit abroad – personal reason)

Absence 2: 10 days (ill-health of an immediate family member requiring my travel overseas)

Total Absence: 20 days



I will be physically in Malaysia immediately before and after each absence.

Thus, the total absence from Malaysia in 2025 will be 20 days in total (10 + 10).

My questions for official confirmation:

As per Section 7(1)(b) and the temporary-absence provisions, can these two absences (10 days + 10 days) still be treated as temporary absences forming part of my continuous presence, given that one is a social visit (≤ 14 days) and the other is for ill-health (immediate family member)?

Will this affect my eligibility to link the year 2025 to 2026 for tax-residency purposes under the “linking rule”?

What supporting documents should I keep or submit (e.g., medical proof, passport stamps) to substantiate this position during filing or any future verification?

4. In my case, Can I claim back my excess tax for 2025 and 2026 after becoming a resident in 2026 ? 

I sincerely appreciate your time and guidance on this matter.

A written clarification from your office will help me ensure my tax filings and records are fully compliant with LHDN requirements.



Thank you very much.



Warm regards,

Pradeep Kandasamy
